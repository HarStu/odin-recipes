# odin-recipes

This is my first project for the Odin Project Foundations course. It demonstrates and tests a basic grasp of HTML, covering text, lists, links, and images. It additionally demonstrates and tests a basic grasp of using Git and GitHub. 

The project consists of a homepage which links to several recipes. Each page contains text, images, and links to other pages.

It has also been updated to include CSS
